# Wordle

A word game named Wordle has gained popularity recently. The game Wordle is
challenging but simple: Once a day, players have six guesses to identify a new five-letter
word (all players receive the same word on a given day). Each guess provides color-coded hints: a letter turns green if it is in the correct
spot, yellow if it is part of the word but in a different spot, and gray if it is not in the word at all.

In this project, I developed a simplified version of this game.
